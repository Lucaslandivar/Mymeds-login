<h2>Description of the project</h2>
<p>In my past projects, I performed two types of login, where one was for better styling and the other was for more functionality. I took full advantage of both projects, thus leaving a beautiful interface and a functional login system.
This project is not yet 100% finished, in the future I want to improve it, using a database (MySQL) to authenticate the data and also, that once the user enters, he can go to the dashboard.
What do I want to do or what is my plan with this project right now? I want to implement the knowledge acquired in my other projects, where I store user information in the browser, and I also want it to really work, taking the user to the homepage. I also want to put as much information as possible in all the sections (about, contact, e.t.c) to make the login part almost 100% complete.</p>

<h2>Why i make this project?</h2>
<p>I make this project so i can improve my login interface for my main project (Mymeds).</p>

<h2>How does this project work?</h2>
<P>It have the same funcionalitie of my last project (login website), but i want to increase more options, like the password generator, wich i learn how to do with my Password Generator project.</p>
